# C4-Free Subgraphs of Hypercubes

Supplementary data, code, and paper accompanying work by **Minamo Minamoto** (2026)
on quadrilateral-free (C4-free) subgraphs of the hypercubes Q6, Q7, and Q8.

Preprint: **arXiv:2603.29127** (v1–v4: *New Lower Bounds for C4-Free Subgraphs of
the Hypercubes Q6, Q7, and Q8: Constructions, Structure, and Computational
Method*). This repository now corresponds to the **revised** manuscript,
*C4-Free Subgraphs of the Hypercubes Q6, Q7, and Q8: Odd Squares, Fully
Frustrated Models, and Computational Structure*, which supersedes v4's
Q8 result — see "What changed" below.

## Main results

| n | \|E(Qn)\| | ex(Qn, C4) | Source |
|---|-----------|------------|--------|
| 6 | 192 | **= 132** | Harborth–Nienborg 1994 (lower-bound side reproduced here independently; upper bound not independently re-verified, see paper) |
| 7 | 448 | **≥ 304** | Not new: follows from Derrida–Pomeau–Toulouse–Vannimenus (1979), reproduced/audited here |
| 8 | 1024 | **≥ 682** | Witness attaining the bound reported by Marinari–Parisi–Ritort (1995); explicit certificate obtained and verified here |

Within the **odd-square subclass** (edge sets meeting every 4-cycle an odd
number of times, equivalent to fully frustrated signed hypercubes), the
paper proves the subclass value g(n) exactly: **g(6)=132, g(7)=304,
g(8)=682**. All three are self-contained here: each upper bound follows
from the paper's field-bound lemma plus an elementary quantisation
argument, and each lower bound has an explicit odd-square edge list in
this repository, machine-checked by `verify.py`. This does not resolve ex(Q7,C4) or ex(Q8,C4) themselves, which
remain open — see the paper's Open Problems.

## What changed from the original (v1–v4) submission

After the original manuscript was circulated, a reader (S. Lai) identified
an overlooked connection to the statistical-physics literature on fully
frustrated hypercubes (Derrida–Pomeau–Toulouse–Vannimenus 1979;
Marinari–Parisi–Ritort 1995). This led to:

- An improved Q8 lower bound: **680 → 682** edges (the 680-edge conjecture
  is withdrawn).
- Withdrawal of the claim that the Q7 bound (304) is novel — it follows
  from the 1979 construction.
- A self-contained graph-theoretic theorem/certificate determining the odd-square subclass exactly for n=6,7,8; the numerical values themselves have historical priority in DPTV79 (n=6,7) and MPR95's reported n=8 attainment.
- An audit of the original 19,866 Q7 solutions: only 389 of them are
  odd-square; the rest are not, so the odd-square construction does not
  explain the bulk of the structural classification.
- A Q6 odd-square witness (`q6_odd_square_132.json`) and an exact
  solution of the field-bound integer programme, which together remove
  the paper's earlier reliance on Harborth–Nienborg and on DPTV79's
  unreconstructed D=6 configuration for the value g(6)=132.
- The full Aut(Q7) orbit census is now shipped as a **completed artefact**:
  `q7_orbit_census.json` (orbit assignment of all 19,866 solutions to the
  180 orbits, per-orbit catalogue counts, stabiliser orders, orbit lengths,
  and the 34,227,200 labelled total), together with the finished resume
  checkpoint `q7_orbit_census_ckpt.npz`. The lightweight
  `q7_orbit_census_check.py` verifies the artefact's internal consistency
  and every census-derived number stated in the paper in under a second,
  and is wired into `reproduce_core.py`'s default path. The strong route is
  `reproduce_core.py --structural`, which now re-runs the census **from
  scratch**: it invokes `q7_orbit_census.py --fresh` (separate
  `q7_orbit_census_fresh_ckpt.npz` / `q7_orbit_census_fresh.json` files;
  the bundled checkpoint is never read), runs it to completion, and then
  requires the fresh JSON to be SHA-256 byte-identical to the released
  `q7_orbit_census.json`.
- Two further dependency-free checks are wired into `reproduce_core.py`'s
  default path: `cycle_space_rank.py` asserts by direct GF(2) elimination
  that the squares of Q_n span its cycle space for n=3..8 (rank = E−V+1 =
  (n−2)·2^(n−1)+1, i.e. 5, 17, 49, 129, 321, 769), and
  `field_identity_defect.py` verifies the paper's exact defect formula
  Σ_{v∈U} h(v)² = n²·2^(n−1) − 4·Σ_s spl_U(s) — including every quoted
  split histogram and total — on the released certificates and on seeded
  random edge sets.
- `q7_lambda1_by_type.py` (numpy) recomputes the paper's 20-row
  dimension-profile table directly from the released catalogue — per-type
  solution counts, profile entropies, and the per-type **mean** spectral
  radius λ₁ — and asserts every printed figure against the paper, together
  with the exhaustive individual-solution range [4.78543, 4.79129]. A
  pre-release review noted these type means were re-derivable but not printed
  by any bundled script; this closes that gap. Run by
  `reproduce_core.py --structural`.
- `cross_verify.py` is a bundled INDEPENDENT re-implementation of the
  certificate checks, sharing no code and no core mechanism with
  `verify.py`: C4-freeness and the odd-square condition via bitmask
  common-neighbour counting over Hamming-distance-2 pairs (instead of
  square enumeration by corner tuples), and catalogue-level distinctness
  of the 19,866 edge sets via a sorted-tuple set (no hashing). Standard
  library only, about 30 s; run by `reproduce_core.py` by default. It
  makes the manuscript's single-implementation-risk mitigation auditable
  (a pre-release review noted the previously reported second implementation
  was not preserved in the release). Both verifiers are AI-assisted, as the
  manuscript's Use-of-AI section discloses: their independence is at the
  algorithm/implementation level, not a human-written check against an
  AI-written one.
- `q7_orbit_witnesses.json` + `q7_orbit_witness_check.py`: an
  orbit-witness CERTIFICATE for the Aut(Q7) orbit decomposition. The
  JSON records, for each of the 19,866 solutions, a group element mapping
  its orbit representative to it, and per orbit the lexicographically
  minimal incidence vector over all 645,120 images (the canonical form)
  plus an element attaining it. The checker's default mode (standard
  library, ~16 s) verifies every witness, the identity of the certified
  assignment with the released census, attainment of every canonical
  form, and their pairwise distinctness — certifying the assignment and
  "at most 180 orbits" without any group sweep. `--canonical` (numpy,
  census-scale wall time, sliceable with `--orbits A:B` for time-limited
  environments; ~400 s here as three slices) re-verifies that each
  canonical form is the true orbit minimum, which together with
  distinctness certifies "exactly 180" independently of the census scan.
  Default mode runs in `reproduce_core.py`'s default path; `--canonical`
  in `--structural`. The generator (`q7_orbit_witnesses_gen.py`, numpy,
  checkpointed) is included for regeneration; it asserts its assignment
  equals the released census before writing.
- `verify.py` now also asserts **catalogue-level pairwise distinctness** of
  the 19,866 Q7 edge sets (previously its "no duplicates" check was only
  per-solution), and `reproduce_core.py` now regression-tests the byte-exact
  (SHA-256) reproduction of `q8_A_witness.json` from seed 90008 at the
  default budget instead of merely re-running the search.

## Reproducibility: one command

**Resource note.** `verify.py` (and hence `reproduce_core.py`) loads all 19,866
Q7 solutions into memory at once; peak RSS is around 700 MB, comparable to
`analyze_q7_structure.py`. Budget roughly 1 GB of free memory; on a single modern core `verify.py` takes
about 20 seconds and `analyze_q7_structure.py` two to three minutes (both
machine-dependent); `--structural` adds the expensive numpy passes.

**Measured environment and timings.** All wall times quoted in
this README and in the paper were measured on: one vCPU of an Intel Xeon @
2.10 GHz, ~4 GB RAM, Linux, Python 3.12.3, numpy 2.4.4 (no GPU is used by
any script; everything here is single-core CPU work). `requirements.txt`
pins `numpy==2.4.4` — the version under which the published SHA-256 values
were generated and re-verified; a pre-release reviewer independently
reproduced every numpy-dependent result and SHA-256 value under 2.4.4, and
we observed no version sensitivity across the 2.3/2.4 series. Measured on this machine: `reproduce_core.py`
(default, standard library only) 85 s end to end; within it,
`q8_A_recover.py --seeds 90008 --iters 250000` takes 18 s standalone — but
this is the most hardware-sensitive step (one review environment reported
over 600 s without completing; the search recomputes local fields broadly
at each proposal), so treat its runtime as highly variable.
`q7_orbit_census.py --fresh` ran to completion in 362 s of census work
(here as two checkpointed invocations of 201 s + 161 s) plus 9 s for
`--fresh --stabilisers`; note the census budget takes effect only
**between** orbits, so on slower hardware a single large orbit can run for
several minutes before the first checkpoint is written — use generous
budgets there. `q7_lambda1_by_type.py` takes about 6 s. Later additions in this
revision: `cross_verify.py` about 30 s; `q7_orbit_witness_check.py` default mode
about 16 s, and `--canonical` about 400 s total (run here as three
`--orbits` slices of ~133 s each); generating the witness certificate
from scratch (`q7_orbit_witnesses_gen.py`) took 529 s over three
checkpointed invocations. `verify_q6_ilp_map.py` (standard library, <1 s, default path)
machine-checks the Q6 ILP provenance bijections: the CSV's 192 variables
onto the 192 edges of Q6, and the MPS's 240 constraints onto the 240
squares. `verify.py` now also checks the regenerable
second Q8 certificate `q8_A_witness.json` (odd-square condition, 682
edges, and its non-edge violation distribution {3:42, 4:151, 5:133,
6:16}) alongside the historical `q8_odd_square_682.json`.

**Certifying "exactly 180 orbits".** The quick default checks certify the
orbit *assignment* ("at most 180"). Exactness has two independent routes,
run either as a distinct required step if you need the full theorem-level
claim: `python3 q7_orbit_witness_check.py --canonical` (numpy;
census-scale wall time; sliceable as finely as needed in time-limited
environments — `--orbits 0:60` ≈ 133 s here, `--orbits 0:20` ≈ 45 s, and a
240 s per-command cap fits three 0:20-sized slices) re-verifies each stored canonical form as the true orbit
minimum, which with their pairwise distinctness proves exactness; or
`python3 reproduce_core.py --structural`, which additionally reruns the
census from scratch and requires byte-identity with the released
artefact (and itself includes `--canonical`).

Every C4-free claim is independently re-checkable with a dependency-free
script (standard library only; no third-party packages, no network):

```bash
python3 verify.py
```

`verify.py` reads each solution, checks that every edge is a valid Q_n edge
with no loops or duplicates and exactly the claimed edge count, certifies
C4-freeness by **exhaustively enumerating all four-cycles** of Q_n, and
(for the Q6 and Q8 odd-square witnesses) additionally checks the stronger
odd-square condition (every square has exactly 1 or 3 edges, not merely
not-4). It also recomputes the manuscript's non-edge C4-violation
distributions for both 680-edge Q8 solutions, the 682-edge odd-square Q8
witness, and the Q6 odd-square witness, so the stated local-maximality margins
are part of the public verifier rather than prose-only claims. It also asserts
that the 19,866 Q7 edge sets are pairwise distinct **across the catalogue**
(SHA-256 over each sorted edge list) — a different check from the
per-solution "no duplicates" above, which only forbids a repeated edge inside
one solution. For the Q7 catalogue, the 389 odd-square members are checked by
`audit_q7_odd_square.py`; Solution A's incidental odd-squareness and the
Q7 structural assertions are covered by the dedicated analysis/audit scripts
and the explicit Q7 checks now included in `verify.py`. It prints the SHA-256 of each data file and exits 0 iff every
check passes.
Four-cycles enumerated per solution ( C(n,2) · 2^(n-2) ): Q6 = 240,
Q7 = 672 (for all 19,866 solutions), Q8 = 1,792.

The data-file hashes are also recorded in two manifests, checkable with
standard tools:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c ORIGINAL_DATA_SHA256SUMS.txt     # macOS
sha256sum -c ORIGINAL_DATA_SHA256SUMS.txt         # Linux
sha256sum -c ODDSQUARE_BRIDGE_SHA256SUMS.txt      # odd-square material
```

### Important: run recovered search scripts in a working copy

**Also on this list:** `q8_A_recover.py` and `q8_B_recover.py` both *used to* default their `--output` to a file listed in `ODDSQUARE_BRIDGE_SHA256SUMS.txt`. They now default to `q8_A_witness_run.json` and `q8_B_witnesses_run.json` respectively, so a bare run no longer overwrites a certified artefact. If you pass `--output` explicitly, avoid the manifest names.

The recovered production-history scripts write fixed filenames in the current
working directory. **Do not run them in the manifest-listed release directory.**
Copy the files you need to a disposable working directory first. In particular:

- `source.py` and `sa_search.py` overwrite `selected_edges_best.json`;
- `sa_collect304.py` writes/appends `solutions_304.jsonl` and can overwrite
  `selected_edges_best.json` if it reaches 305 edges;
- `sa_q8.py` writes/overwrites `q8_best.json`;
- `source.py` also writes `selected_edges_<k>.txt` for the edge count it reaches
  (e.g. `selected_edges_295.txt` on a cold start);
- `search_q6.py` and `q7_orbit_census.py` create side products such as
  `q6_spins.txt`, `q7_orbit_census_ckpt.npz`, and `q7_orbit_census.json` —
  and the latter two are now **certified, manifest-listed artefacts** of this
  release, so running the census inside the release directory writes over
  certified files. (Against the bundled completed checkpoint it resumes,
  finds nothing left to do, and rewrites the same content — but treat it as
  an overwrite risk and prefer a working copy. The `--fresh` mode writes
  only the two `_fresh` files and never touches the certified pair.)

The SHA-256 manifests integrity-check only the files explicitly listed in them (they detect alteration or file mix-ups; absent an externally signed digest they do not by themselves prove authorship).
Additional generated files do not invalidate a manifest, but overwriting a
listed seed/data file does. `reproduce_core.py` already uses temporary
directories for the regeneration steps that would otherwise write outputs.

### Dependencies for the search/solver scripts

`verify.py`, `generate_q6_132.py`, `search_q6.py`, `generate_q8_682.py`,
`audit_q7_odd_square.py`, `solve_field_ip.py`, `q6_decide_realizability.py`,
`cycle_space_rank.py`, `field_identity_defect.py`,
and `reproduce_core.py` use only the Python standard library, as noted above.
`q7_hamming_tally.py`, `q7_order3_automorphisms.py`, `q7_oddsquare_orbits.py`
and `q7_orbit_census.py` additionally need `numpy`.

Input conventions differ and are intentional:

| script | Q7 input convention |
|---|---|
| `analyze_q7_structure.py` | requires the three part-file paths as positional arguments |
| `audit_q7_odd_square.py` | requires the three part-file paths as positional arguments |
| `type18_automorphisms.py` | accepts the three part-file paths after its options |
| `q7_hamming_tally.py` | takes **no** part-file arguments; reads the fixed `q7_edges_304.jsonl.part1`--`part3` names from CWD. Recomputes the exhaustive pairwise Hamming statistics from one blocked matrix product and tallies the **636 minimum-distance (d=6) pairs across 28 profile-type combinations** stated in the paper's Abstract and Section 6.3; with `--csv` it regenerates `q7_min_distance_pairs.csv` byte-identically |
| `q7_order3_automorphisms.py` | takes **no** part-file arguments; reads the fixed part names from CWD |
| `q7_oddsquare_orbits.py` | takes **no** arguments; reads the fixed part names from CWD, **and also requires `q7_odd_square_389.csv`** in CWD (it takes the 389 indices from that released file rather than recomputing the audit, so run `audit_q7_odd_square.py` first if you want the CSV regenerated) |
| `q7_orbit_census.py` | takes **no** part-file arguments; reads the fixed part names from CWD and writes/resumes a checkpoint there |
| `q8_A_recover.py` | takes **no** required arguments; needs no input files. The defaults (`--seeds 90000..90011 --iters 250000`) reproduce the released `q8_A_witness.json` exactly (seed 90008, iteration 207579). **`--iters` is not just a stopping rule** — it enters the annealing temperature schedule, so a different budget finds a different (equally valid) witness. Writes to `q8_A_witness_run.json`, **not** to the manifest-listed `q8_A_witness.json`. |
| `q6_parity_obstruction.py` | takes **no** arguments; needs no input files |
| `cycle_space_rank.py` | takes **no** arguments; needs no input files |
| `field_identity_defect.py` | takes **no** arguments; reads the fixed certificate names from CWD (`q6_odd_square_132.json`, `q6_edges_132.jsonl`, `q7_edges_304.jsonl.part1`, `q8_odd_square_682.json`, `q8_edges_680.jsonl`) |
| `q7_lambda1_by_type.py` | optional positional arguments: the three part files (defaults: fixed names from CWD); requires numpy |
| `cross_verify.py` | takes **no** arguments; reads the fixed certificate names from CWD |
| `q7_orbit_witness_check.py` | takes no required arguments; reads the three part files, `q7_orbit_witnesses.json` and `q7_orbit_census.json` from CWD; `--canonical [--orbits A:B]` needs numpy |
| `q7_orbit_witnesses_gen.py` | generator for `q7_orbit_witnesses.json` (numpy; `--budget` seconds, checkpointed in `q7_orbit_witnesses_ckpt.npz`); not needed for verification |
| `q6_other_distributions.py` | to reproduce the released 20-row control CSV **byte-identically**, the invocation is exactly `python3 q6_other_distributions.py --profile paper --targets C --iters 60000 --csv q6_realized_control_results.csv --json q6_realized_control_summary.json` (this is what `reproduce_core.py --experiments` runs). Running `--profile paper --control` instead **appends** the control runs to the A/B results and yields an 80-row CSV that will not match the released 20-row file. The iteration budgets differ by design and match the paper's protocol: 300,000 for the A/B targets, 60,000 for the realised-distribution control — the budget asymmetry the paper itself flags. |

The three conventions above (positional part files, optional part files, fixed names read from CWD) are a historical artefact of when each script was written. Rather than change interfaces that reviewers have already exercised, the simplest advice is: **run everything from the directory containing the released files, and use `reproduce_core.py`**, which supplies the right arguments to each script. If you invoke a script directly and it exits with `FileNotFoundError` or an argparse usage message, consult the row above rather than guessing.

`q7_orbit_census.py` works to a time budget (`--budget`, default 250 s) and
saves a checkpoint: a full census needs several invocations, each resuming
automatically, and exits with code 2 while incomplete. On the reference machine
(single core) three invocations at the default budget sufficed; slower machines
need more — independent review environments have needed over 20 minutes in
total, so treat any per-machine estimate as indicative only. **Rerunning the
census is now optional:** this release bundles the completed artefact
`q7_orbit_census.json` (including the `--stabilisers` data, which the pass now
persists into the JSON) and the finished checkpoint
`q7_orbit_census_ckpt.npz`, so `--report` and `--stabilisers` run in seconds
against the bundled checkpoint, and `q7_orbit_census_check.py` verifies the
artefact against every census-derived number in the paper with no
recomputation at all. A from-scratch rerun is the strong check:
`q7_orbit_census.py --fresh` keeps its checkpoint and JSON in separate
files (`q7_orbit_census_fresh_ckpt.npz` / `q7_orbit_census_fresh.json`),
never reads or writes the bundled pair, resumes its own checkpoint across
invocations, and — the whole computation being deterministic — must
reproduce the released JSON byte for byte on completion; delete the two
`_fresh` files to force a new from-scratch start. `reproduce_core.py
--structural` runs exactly this (removing stale `_fresh` files first) and
then requires SHA-256 identity between `q7_orbit_census_fresh.json` and
the released `q7_orbit_census.json`. The budget is checked only between orbits, and only after this
invocation has completed at least one, so a single slow orbit may overrun it --
that is deliberate, since a partly processed orbit cannot be checkpointed. The
checkpoint stores the catalogue's SHA-256 and a resume against different input is
refused (exit code 3). Its `--stabilisers`
mode now **refuses to run unless all 19,866 solutions have non-negative orbit
IDs in a completed census**; this prevents an incomplete checkpoint (or no
checkpoint) from silently treating orbit ID `-1` as a real orbit and printing a
plausible but false stabiliser summary. Once the census is complete the mode
takes seconds. Its JSON output now keeps `catalogue_sizes` aligned with the orbit IDs used by `assignment` and also writes a separately sorted `catalogue_sizes_sorted` list for rank summaries. The recovered production-history scripts need further third-party
packages. All of these are pinned in the provided `requirements.txt`
(install as needed):

- `source.py` (bundled): `highspy`
- `source_72h.py` (not bundled): `highspy` (tested with
  1.15.1)
- `source_cbc_origin.py`: `pulp`, `networkx`, `numpy`
- `analyze_q7_structure.py`: `numpy` only
- `sa_search.py`, `sa_collect304.py`, `sa_q8.py`, `c4free_sa.py`:
  standard library only (`random`, `json`, `time`, `math`, `os`,
  `hashlib`)

## Paper and code

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `c4free_hypercube_v5.pdf` | The revised paper (PDF) |
| `c4free_hypercube_v5.tex` | LaTeX source of the revised paper |
| `c4free_sa.py` | Two-phase simulated-annealing search originally reported for the Q7/Q8 lower bounds. **Known bug, documented in the script and in the paper:** the Aut(Q_n)-based diversification restart is computed but never passed into `phase1_sa`, which always initialises from a fresh random sample and gets permanently stuck (see the paper's Computational Method section). This script is **not** the identified production script for the released Q8 680-edge solutions (that is `sa_q8.py`, tracked in the paper's Sections 4 and 7); whether it played any historical role in that lineage is unknown. |
| `sa_search.py`, `sa_collect304.py`, `selected_edges_best.json` | **Recovered production code for the Q7 results** (recovered after `c4free_sa.py` was found not to explain the Q7 provenance). `sa_search.py` is a conventional penalty SA (add/remove/1-swap/kick moves, temperature-scaled Boltzmann acceptance); as released here it loads `selected_edges_best.json` unconditionally (no random/greedy fallback), and that file already contains the final 304-edge solution, so running it as packaged searches for improvements *beyond* 304 edges, not a from-scratch discovery of the first 304-edge solution. `sa_search.py` also has a known implementation defect: its `cur_list`/`mis_list` candidate lists are only rebuilt every 5,000 iterations while the underlying sets are updated every iteration, so a stale list entry can be sampled and the tracked violation count can in principle drift from the true value, which is never re-verified before saving. This does not affect the released certificates (independently re-verified `C_4`-free regardless of which script produced them), but affects trust in the script's own internal bookkeeping. `sa_collect304.py` mass-collects further solutions by removing a few edges from an existing solution (optionally automorphism-transformed) and greedily repairing; it does not share `sa_search.py`'s two defects above, but has a known defect of its own in `canonicalize()`: the intended flip-canonicalisation never executes and permutation ties are broken non-canonically, so **the stored `hash` field must not be read as de-duplication across Aut(Q7)** — see the paper's Section 7 for the complete two-defect analysis with the numeric exhibits (92/100 hash divergence under a corrected implementation; hash instability under a tied-direction swap), and the completed orbit census (`q7_orbit_census.json`: 180 orbits behind the 19,866 records) for how large that duplication actually is. Operationally verified from the released files alone: a 30-second run from the released seed finds ~2,000 new valid solutions, and applying the hash function *exactly as implemented* to all 19,866 released edge sets reproduces the stored `hash` field with zero mismatches (format-consistency, not provenance). Note also that `sa_collect304.py`'s `RUNTIME` constant (36 hours) has no command-line override: to run it briefly, either edit that constant or wrap the invocation in an external `timeout`, as documented for `sa_q8.py`. |
| `source.py` | **Recovered code for the origin of the Q7 304-edge solution chain**, tracing back further than the SA-based scripts above. A from-scratch HiGHS ILP solve of the square-≤3-edges formulation, with no warm start when `selected_edges_best.json` does not yet exist. Verified: run for 60 seconds with no pre-existing warm-start file (a genuine cold start), it produces a valid, growing 295-edge C4-free solution via HiGHS branch-and-bound alone. File timestamps and a recovered 72-hour solver log (not bundled, ~4.7MB) are consistent with a documented progression 289→301→303 edges (the first two steps via this same ILP lineage), with the final 303→304 step apparently made by the `sa_search.py` series above. |
| `source_cbc_origin.py` | **The earliest recovered attempt on this problem**, dated over a week before every other file in this archive: a CBC-solver (not HiGHS) ILP of the same formulation, explicitly commented "Erdős's $\\$100 problem, the n=7 case." This specific file has a confirmed bug: its C4-detection computes common neighbours of adjacent vertices, but Q7 is bipartite, so adjacent vertices never share a common neighbour; it finds 0 of 672 C4s and builds an ILP with no C4 constraints at all. The 289-edge result described in Section 7 was reached by a since-lost corrected version of this script; only a recovered solver log (not bundled) documents that result. This file is released for provenance completeness, not as a functional solver. |
| `sa_q8.py`, `q8_solution_a.txt`, `q8_solution_b.json` | **Verified, working production code for the Q8 680-edge results.** `sa_q8.py` is a penalty-SA hill-climber that, unlike `c4free_sa.py`, always restarts each trial from the current best *valid* (zero-violation) solution rather than from a fresh random sample, so it never has to escape a large initial violation count. `q8_solution_a.txt`/`q8_solution_b.json` are the recovered outputs, verified to match released Solution A and Solution B exactly by edge set. An old aggregate trial count for failed 681-edge attempts is not repeated in the revised paper because no corresponding seed list or log was recovered; it is not used as evidence. |
| `q8_checkpoint_670.json` | A recovered 670-edge intermediate solution. To reproduce our finding that the code makes genuine progress (an external 90-second timeout reduces the violation count at the 675-edge target from 22 to 8 in one run — exact numbers won't repeat, since `sa_q8.py` sets no random seed): `cp q8_checkpoint_670.json q8_best.json`, then `timeout 90 python3 sa_q8.py` in the same directory. Use an external timeout, not the script's internal `RUNTIME` variable — `RUNTIME` is only checked once per outer trial, while each trial's inner Phase-1 loop runs 2–12 million steps with no time check inside it, so editing `RUNTIME` alone won't reliably stop execution near that value. Without `q8_best.json` present, `sa_q8.py` instead starts from a fresh greedy construction. |
| `verify.py` | Dependency-free verifier (re-checks every certificate from scratch, including Q7 catalogue local maximality/edge coverage, catalogue-level pairwise distinctness of the 19,866 edge sets, and the Q6/Q8 non-edge violation distributions used for local-maximality margins) |
| `q7_orbit_census_check.py` | Lightweight (standard library, <1 s) consistency checker for the completed census artefact `q7_orbit_census.json`: orbit count, full assignment coverage, per-orbit catalogue counts, stabiliser histogram {3:142, 6:32, 12:4, 24:1, 72:1}, orbit lengths and the 34,227,200 total, and the Type-18 tie-in (55 and 46). Run by `reproduce_core.py` by default. |
| `generate_q6_132.py` | Regenerates and self-checks the 132-edge Q6 odd-square witness from its 64-bit spin configuration, using the same canonical fully frustrated coupling as the Q8 script. |
| `search_q6.py` | The fixed-seed (20260823) simulated-annealing search that produced that spin configuration; reached 132 edges on its first trial, and reproduces exactly because the seed is fixed. Also verifies that the coupling is fully frustrated on Q6 (all 240 squares). |
| `solve_field_ip.py` | Solves the paper's field-bound integer programme exhaustively by dynamic programming (no sign restriction), returning optima 72 / 160 / 340 for n = 6 / 7 / 8 and enumerating the 3 / 1 / 2 optimal local-field distributions. A cross-check on the paper's closed-form argument, not a substitute for it. |
| `generate_q8_682.py` | Regenerates and self-checks the 682-edge Q8 odd-square witness from its 256-bit spin configuration, derived by the author (17-18 Aug 2026) using MPR's canonical fully frustrated coupling and independently cross-checked by S. Lai; see the paper (Section 5.3) for the full account. |
| `verify_q8_B_witnesses.py` | Verifies the two explicit witnesses for the second optimal n=8 field distribution, including the U histogram `{2:87,4:40,6:1}`, the opposite-side histogram `{0:1,2:84,4:43}`, odd-squareness, checksums, and each witness's non-edge C4-violation distribution (minimum margin 3). |
| `audit_q7_odd_square.py` (run as `python3 audit_q7_odd_square.py q7_edges_304.jsonl.part1 q7_edges_304.jsonl.part2 q7_edges_304.jsonl.part3`; the three part files are required arguments) | Audits the 19,866 released Q7 solutions against the odd-square condition (389 satisfy it) |
| `ORIGINAL_DATA_SHA256SUMS.txt` | SHA-256 certificate for the original data files and `c4free_sa.py` |
| `ODDSQUARE_BRIDGE_SHA256SUMS.txt` | SHA-256 certificate for the odd-square reconstruction/audit material |

## Data files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `q6_ilp.mps` | ILP in MPS format (192 variables, 240 constraints) for the Q6 upper bound. Optimality was not independently closed within a practical runtime with a generic solver (see paper, Section 8.2); the upper bound ex(Q6,C4)≤132 rests on Harborth–Nienborg's combinatorial proof. |
| `q6_ilp_edge_map.csv` | Reconstructed x_i ↔ Q6-edge correspondence for `q6_ilp.mps` (not originally recorded; reconstructed by matching the MPS's variable-constraint incidence against Q6's known edge-square structure, verified to reproduce all 240 constraints exactly). |
| `q7_edges_304.jsonl.part{1,2,3}` | The 19,866 distinct 304-edge C4-free subgraphs of Q7 (split into 3 parts) |
| `analyze_q7_structure.py` | Recomputes the paper's Section 6 structural/statistical claims (degree sequence, dimension-profile classification, spectral-radius range, exhaustive pairwise Hamming-distance stats, Type-18 nontrivial-automorphism existence) directly from `q7_edges_304.jsonl.part1-3`. Standard library + numpy only. Verified: reproduces the numerical claims in that script's stated scope exactly; the order-3 automorphism count is checked separately by `q7_order3_automorphisms.py`/`type18_automorphisms.py`. Peak memory is around 600–800 MB for the frozenset solution store alone (the Python `frozenset`-of-`frozenset` representation of 19,866 solutions has substantial per-object overhead); wall time is typically 3–10 minutes depending on hardware. The `CHUNK` constant controls the Hamming-distance batch size and does not materially affect peak memory, which is dominated by the solution store. Does not itself determine automorphism *order* (the 46/101 order-3 figure elsewhere in the paper used a separate, more detailed check). |
| `q8_edges_680.jsonl` | Two distinct 680-edge C4-free subgraphs of Q8 (Solution A and Solution B; see paper for how they differ) |
| `q6_odd_square_132.json` | The 132-edge odd-square witness for Q6. **Not the same edge set as `q6_edges_132.jsonl`** — their symmetric difference has size `|E △ E'| = 62`; both are 132-edge C4-free subgraphs of Q6, but only this one is odd-square (square histogram `{1:30, 3:210}` vs `{1:8, 2:44, 3:188}`). Its non-edge C4-violation distribution is `{2:2, 3:29, 4:26, 5:3}`. |
| `q8_odd_square_682.json` | The 682-edge odd-square witness for Q8 (current headline lower bound) |
| `q7_odd_square_389.csv` | The 389 (of 19,866) Q7 solutions that satisfy the odd-square condition, with their dimension profiles |
| `q7_min_distance_pairs.csv` | The 636 minimum-distance (Hamming 6) pairs among the 19,866 solutions with their 28 profile-type combinations; regenerated byte-identically by `q7_hamming_tally.py --csv` |
| `q7_orbit_census.json` | **Completed orbit-census artefact**: orbit assignment of all 19,866 solutions (180 orbits), per-orbit catalogue counts, stabiliser orders, orbit lengths, and the 34,227,200 labelled total. Verified in <1 s by `q7_orbit_census_check.py`. |
| `q7_orbit_census_ckpt.npz` | The finished census checkpoint, so `q7_orbit_census.py --report` / `--stabilisers` run in seconds without redoing the census |

### Auxiliary / historical data (used by no theorem in the revised paper)

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `q6_edges_132.jsonl` | A second, historically earlier 132-edge C4-free subgraph of Q6. **Not odd-square** (square histogram `{1:8, 2:44, 3:188}`) and **not used by any theorem of the revised paper**: the operative machine-verified witness for both ex(Q6,C4) ≥ 132 and g(6) ≥ 132 is `q6_odd_square_132.json` (odd-square implies C4-free). It is also the only certificate in this release whose generating search is untraced — no recovered production script or historical run log connects this particular file to a run. Retained for the record from the v1–v4 releases, still independently verified by `verify.py`, and still listed in `ORIGINAL_DATA_SHA256SUMS.txt`. **Do not conflate the two 132-edge Q6 files** (their symmetric difference is 62 edges). |

Each `.jsonl` line is a JSON object `{"edges": [[u, v], ...]}` with vertices
encoded as integers `0 … 2^n − 1`. To reconstruct the full Q7 set:

```bash
cat q7_edges_304.jsonl.part1 q7_edges_304.jsonl.part2 q7_edges_304.jsonl.part3 > q7_solutions_all.jsonl
```

## Upper bound (Q6)

The ILP in `q6_ilp.mps` gives a feasible value matching 132 with any MIP
solver, but did not close to a proven optimum within a practical runtime
in our own tests (HiGHS 1.15.1 via `highspy`, single thread, 240-second
limit: primal −132, dual bound −140, a 6.06% gap after 60,146
branch-and-bound nodes); see the paper for details. This is machine-dependent and is not presented as a benchmark. The upper bound ex(Q6,C4)≤132 itself
rests on Harborth and Nienborg's independent combinatorial proof (1994).

```bash
scip -f q6_ilp.mps          # SCIP
# or in Python (pyscipopt):
#   from pyscipopt import Model
#   m = Model(); m.readProblem("q6_ilp.mps"); m.optimize()
#   print(int(-m.getObjVal()))   # feasible value, not necessarily proven optimal quickly
```

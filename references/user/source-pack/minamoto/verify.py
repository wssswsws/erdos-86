verify.py — dependency-free verifier for the C4-free hypercube constructions.

Standard library only (json, hashlib, itertools, sys); Python 3.8+.
No third-party packages, no network access.

For each n in {6, 7, 8} this script:
  - reads every solution (JSON, key "edges": a list of [u, v] integer pairs,
    vertices in 0 .. 2^n - 1; one object per line for the multi-solution files);
  - checks every edge is a valid Q_n edge (endpoints differ in exactly one bit),
    with no loops, no duplicates, and exactly the claimed edge count;
  - certifies C4-freeness by EXHAUSTIVELY enumerating all four-cycles of Q_n
    ( C(n,2) * 2^(n-2) of them: 240 for Q6, 672 for Q7, 1792 for Q8 )
    and confirming none of them is fully present;
  - prints the SHA-256 of each data file as a fixed-version certificate.

Additionally, for the two dedicated odd-square witnesses (q6_odd_square_132.json and
q8_odd_square_682.json) this script independently checks the stronger
odd-square condition: every square must meet the edge set in exactly 1 or 3
edges (not merely "not 4"). These checks are independent of the self-checks
performed by generate_q6_132.py and generate_q8_682.py; this script does not
import or reuse either script's logic. For the Q7 catalogue it also checks the
two inexpensive structural assertions stated in the paper: every one of
the 19,866 solutions is locally maximal in Q7, and their union covers all 448
Q7 edges. It also asserts catalogue-level pairwise distinctness: the 19,866
normalised edge sets are all different from one another (checked via SHA-256
over each sorted edge list; this is a different check from the per-solution
"no duplicates" above, which only forbids a repeated edge INSIDE one
solution). It also independently confirms that the first released 680-edge Q8
solution (Solution A) is odd-square.

Note that q6_edges_132.jsonl and q6_odd_square_132.json are two DIFFERENT
132-edge C4-free subgraphs of Q6. Only the latter is odd-square; the former
is checked for C4-freeness alone, above.

Usage:
    python3 verify.py

Exit code is 0 iff every solution passes every check.
